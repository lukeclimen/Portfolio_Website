            <strong>"</strong>Luke was hired directly out of school to our
            energy management firm in Kitchener, Ontario. Over the course of 3
            years with the company, I helped Luke to develop professional skills
            in the energy management sector. He is a fast learner, and was a
            very intelligent colleague.

          <p class="block__content">
            During his time at the company, he led directives to expand company
            offerings to more technical services with Environmental Engineering
            focusses. He also pursued consulting opportunities in the expanding
            carbon-market space.

          <p class="block__content">
            I am impressed with how driven he is in the things he chooses to
            focus on. We quickly connected over our passion in real estate, and
            I provided him with mentoring in the space, as I own several
            investment properties, and he had just purchased his first.
          </p>

          <p class="block__content">
            During a restructuring, he was placed as a direct report to me.
            After realizing that he had a lot to offer in expanding our
            company's services, I leaned heavily on Luke in meetings with
            customers to help them with more technical services, like carbon
            capture and consulting on energy upgrades. He was an invaluable
            asset to me and the sales team.<strong>"</strong>
