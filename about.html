      <h1>Hi, I'm <em>Luke Climenhage</em></h1>
      <p class="info__body">
        Until going back to school in September of 2022, I was an Engineer
        working an energy consulting role at Canadian Energy Strategies, inc.
      </p>
      <p class="info__body">
        I went to the University of Guelph for my (first) Undergraduate degree.
        My program was Biomedical Engineering, which spanned my passions of
        medicine, creation and math. While at the University, I realized that I
        had a passion for creation, which manifested in 3 created products and 2
        startup enterprises.
      </p>
      <p class="info__body">
        While working on these projects on the side, I graduated and found
        employment in the Energy sector, as there were very few biomedical
        companies outside of Toronto. While I pursued a career in the Energy
        Management sector for 3 years, I ultimately realized it was not where my
        passions lay.
      </p>
      <p class="info__body">
        I made the decision to go back to school for Computer Science. I was
        fortunate enough to find Algomau University's Accelerated degree
        program, which allows me to put many of the overlapping classes that I
        took during my Engineering degree towards this degree. I am currently
        looking for Co-op opportunities for September 2023, with an expected
        graduation date in May 2023.
